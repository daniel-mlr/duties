    <h3>Important:</h3>
    <p>
      Please make sure all dishes are washed and all counter tops and dining
      table are clean before you leave the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you make a mess with kitchen appliances or in the fridge, make
      sure you clean it immediately <span>wether or not you're assigned to clean the kitchen
      or wash the floor.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Before putting your dishes in the draining tray, empty it and store items
      in their proper place. If you think it is unfair that the tray is so full
      and that you have only a few items, at least store the equivalent amount
      of items you put in.

      Thank you for making this home a nice place to live.
